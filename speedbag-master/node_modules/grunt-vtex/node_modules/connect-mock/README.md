Connect middleware for easy file-based API mocking

### Usage

First, add files containing your API mock responses to a `mock` directory.
Then, `require` it and call it as a function, passing options.

    mock = require('connect-mock')
    options = {
        mockDirectory: 'mocks/',
        verbose: false
    }
    middlewares.push[mock(options)]

**Important:** If you expect an answer from a endpoint which collides with a directory,
you can use a file with the same name as the directory. See examples in `mock/` folder.
